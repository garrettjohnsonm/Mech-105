## Simpsons function

  This function takes two inputs from the user, x and y, and applies theSimpson's 1/3 rule to this data.  Simpson's 1/3 rule is simply a method of integrating a function. 

  If there are an odd number of intervals, (which means an even number of points was entered) trapezoidal rule will be used to integrate the final interval. 
  
## Inputs:
x= an array (one row vector) of data points to be plotted on the x
x axis THESE NUMBERS BE EQUALLY SPACED

y= an array of data that is to be plotted on the y axis

**The inputed arrays must have the same length or else the function will not
work
The array are 'lined up' and plotted as points as a function, Simpsons 1/3
is then applied to this function.
