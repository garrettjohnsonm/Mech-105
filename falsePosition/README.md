## False Position Function

The purpose of this false position algorithm is to determine the root of a given function.



## Inputs:

*func

*xu

*xl

The user must input the function (func), by creating a func using @x, they want to evaluate along with their
estimates of an upper(xu) and lower(xl) bounds where the function crosses the x
axis. 

## Outputs:

*root 
*error
*iterations

This algorithm will calculate the approximate root between those
points with a certain error and amount of iterations
Check all different combinations of input
